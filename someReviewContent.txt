The Nitro Z-6 costs about $21 grand, including a trailer and Mercury 115-hp OptiMax outboard. The Nitro Z - 6 is a good choice for beginning boat owners, club tournament anglers or anybody wanting to chase fish on a budget.And in case you are wondering, it is one of the best - selling brands on the market.");

Perhaps most importantly, the hulls are the same as her more expensive siblings, and for that reason we expect the ride and the handling to be on a par with them.");

I had to remove the console and floor to get the old tank out and I was amazed at the conditions below decks where I had not been able to see until I opened it up! The hull. stringers. bulkheads were almost new looking with no weak spots, only dirty from some oil that had splashed into the bilge. I have had to keep up with maintenance like fixing some of the wires that had developed corrosion but overall I am still in love with my Wellcraft, enough that I am on my third motor, and am currently replacing some of the worn out canvas on it......I don't know how some of the newer models have been holding out but there is a great number of the older versions still running 70's to 80's models..There is even a forum dedicated just for them...");
